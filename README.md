	Minor fixes concerning compatibility and compiler issues. 
	All [known] issues are fixed, if any other issues come up let me know ASAP. 
	
	The parameter src in the constructor will clone its image/frame into fin.

	This version of the vision is an object oriented version of the first Vision used.
	This is a working and functional version. 
	It is still missing a few features such as distance to object, but those will be added in later. 
	It is constantly being updated with better algorithms and optimization in functions. 
	A few more features will be added. 

	This version has no [known] bugs and is fully functional for use.
